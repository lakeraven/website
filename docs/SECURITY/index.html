<p><strong>Reporting Security Issues</strong></p>
<p>Please refrain from reporting security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.</p>
<p>Instead, kindly report them via the information provided in <a href="https://cloud.gov/.well-known/security.txt">cloud.gov's security.txt</a>.</p>
<p>When reporting, include the following details (as much as possible) to help us understand the nature and extent of the potential issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)</li>
<li>Full paths of related source file(s)</li>
<li>Location of affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)</li>
<li>Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue</li>
<li>Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue</li>
<li>Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)</li>
<li>Impact of the issue, including potential exploitation by attackers</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing this information will facilitate a quicker triage of your report.</p>
