# About Us

Lakeraven is built on a legacy of service. Our team is composed entirely of former federal technologists and accessibility leaders—many from 18F, TTS, and the Presidential Innovation Fellows. We’ve modernized mission-critical systems for federal agencies, states, and tribal governments, bringing empathy, expertise, and a focus on lasting impact.

## Who We Are
* Native-owned, veteran-led
* Former GS-15s, 18F engineers, and digital service experts
* Deep roots in government, tribal affairs, and accessibility

We believe in meeting partners where they are, sharing knowledge, and building internal capacity so that progress continues long after our engagement ends.
